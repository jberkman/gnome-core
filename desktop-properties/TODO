global
- bug in gtk - when rc changes font => improper geometry management
background
screensaver
- position of xlock parent window - something is wrong
- special handling for random mode - maybe make own
- xlock global settings
  xlock settings window buttons don't work (except Cancel)
  xlock Apply button should ghost
  xlock settings window should probably do local grab

- change double-click speed on mouse page
  this requires changes to gtk
- add a way to indication that B1+B3 should generate B2.
  this requires talking to the X server in some nonstandard way

- need configurator to change language and other locale things
