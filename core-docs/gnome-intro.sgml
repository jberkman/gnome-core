    <title>Preface to the alpha release of GNOME</title>
    <para>
      Dear GNOME enthusiast,
    </para>
    <para>
      This document accompanies the alpha release of GNOME, shipped in
      May of 1998.  At this time GNOME is an interesting and useful
      suite of programs, but it is under very active development.
      This means that you will find many programs which are incomplete
      and some bugs which you would not expect from a mature product.</para>
    <para>
      Having said this, GNOME is already today an exciting product,
      and many of its programs are quite useful.

      <title>What is GNOME</title>
      <note>
	<para>
	  If you tire of explanations and just want to get going with
	  GNOME in a practical way, please skip the rest of this
	  preface and read <xref linkend="a-sample-session">
	  immediately.</para>
      </note>
      <para>
	GNOME is a project which endeavors to provide a complete,
	consistent, state of the art and free user environment for
	UNIX systems.  This includes:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	    An <firstterm>application framework</firstterm> &mdash;
	    this consists of a style guide for applications along with
	    a set of libraries which enforce the style requirements.
	    For example, the GNOME libraries allow a programmer to
	    invoke standard menus and dialog boxes.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	    A <firstterm>file manager</firstterm> &mdash; the GNOME
	    file manager is based on the well known <application>GNU
	      midnight commander</application>, which has been endowed
	    with a GNOME&ndash;compliant graphical interface.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	    A <firstterm>panel</firstterm> &mdash; this replaces the
	    button&ndash;bars sometimes provided by UNIX window
	    managers.  The panel also allows the running programs in
	    little squares in the panel, both by swallowing X Window
	    programs and by running especially written
	    <firstterm>applets</firstterm>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	    <firstterm>Session management</firstterm> support &mdash;
	    applications are notified so they can save state
	    information when a user logs out: the next time a session
	    is started, these applications can pick up where they left
	    off.
	    </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	    A <emphasis>suite of GNOME applications</emphasis> &mdash;
	    these have written (or adapted) to use the GNOME
	    facilities, and thus present a consistent look and
	    behaviour.
	  </para>

	There are many more facets to GNOME, and much information can
	be found at the <ulink URL="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME web
	  page</ulink>.
      </para>
      <para>GNOME is a GNU project, was started in 1997, and has
	developed very quickly.  <acronym>GNOME</acronym> can be
	thought of as an acronym standing for GNU Network Object
	Model Environment.

      <title>Obtaining and installing GNOME</title>
      <para>
	GNOME is in early stages and being modified very actively, so
	the only way to get up to date instructions on how to grab and
	install GNOME is to look at the GNOME home page at <ulink

    <title>A sample session</title>
    <para>
      When GNOME becomes stable there will be a simple recipe for
      starting up a GNOME session: users will simply type
      <command>gnome-session</command> and it will start up their
      environment.  But we are not yet at that point: right now UNIX
      users usually run their stable X Window environment with their
      favorite window manager, and the run the GNOME panel and other
      programs from the shell or from their
      <filename>.xsession</filename> or <filename>.xinitrc</filename>
      files.
    </para>
    <para>
      I assume that you have the GNOME programs and libraries
      installed on your system, and that they are in your path.

	code for that language.</para>
      <para>For example, the <command>gnome-hello-2-i18n</command>
	command invokes the <application>gnome-hello</application>
	variant which includes support for internationalization. If

  <chapter>
    <title>A tour of some GNOME applications</title>
    <para>
      I will now give a very brief description of what you can do with
      some GNOME programs.  I have chosen those GNOME programs which
      appear to be reasonably stable; these might be the same programs
      which are being included in the Red Hat Linux 5.1 distribution,
      but that is not clear at this time.</para>
    <sect1>
      <title>The GNOME help browser (gnome-help-browser)</title>
      <para>
	GNOME has a help browser which allows you to view
	documentation in several formats, including UNIX man pages,
	GNU info files and HTML documents.  The documents are shown
	with an HTML rendering widget, so any documentation format
	that can be translated into HTML could be rendered with
	<command>gnome-help-browser</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
	You can invoke the help browser from the penel or from the
	shell by typing
      </para>
      <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gnome-help-browser &</userinput></literallayout>
      <para>
	The initial window you get is shown in <xref
	  linkend="help-browser-initial">
      </para>
      <figure id="help-browser-initial">
	<title>GNOME help browser &mdash; initial screen</title>
	<screenshot>
	  <graphic fileref="pix/help-browser-initial"></graphic>
	</screenshot>
      </figure>

      <para>
	The help browser is well documented, so once you are in it you
	can click on the help icon (which looks like <inlinegraphic
	  fileref="pix/help-icon.gif"></inlinegraphic>) and see the
	help browser's online help.  I will only add one more tip on
	using the help browser: you can invoke it from the command
	line directly and give it a file URL, which has to be a
	complete path to the file.  So if you have just written or
	generated a web page, you could view it with by typing
	<literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gnome-help-browser file:&lt;full-path&gt;/file.html</userinput></literallayout>
	or more conveniently
	<literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gnome-help-browser file:`pwd`/file.html</userinput></literallayout>
      </para>

      <para>
	You can see an example of invoking the help browser on a file
	in <xref linkend="help-browser-sample">: it is a snapshot of
	the top level of this document as I am writing these
	paragraphs.  I invoked it with
	<literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gnome-help-browser file:`pwd`/gnome-intro/book01.html</userinput></literallayout>
      </para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>The <application>panel</application> and its applets</title>
      <para>
	The panel is invoked directly by the GNOME session manager
	when you type <command>gnome-session</command>, but it can be
	also be invoked directly from the shell by typing
      <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>panel &</userinput></literallayout>
      </para>
      <para>
	The panel will bring up a bar at the bottom of the screen,
	shown in <xref linkend="panel-basic"> (note that this bar will
	run across the entire bottom of your screen &mdash; in this
	picture I have narrowed it so that it will fit in a browser
	more conveniently.
      </para>

	<screenshot>
	  <graphic fileref="pix/panel-basic"></graphic>
	</screenshot>
      </figure>

      <para>
	Starting programs with the panel is easy: you simply click on
	the foot icon, from which you will get the top level launcher
	menu, as shown in <xref linkend="panel-menu">.
      </para>
      <figure id="panel-menu">

	  <graphic fileref="pix/panel-menu"></graphic>

      </figure>

      <para>
	Most of the entries in the panel menu are submenus; <xref
	linkend="panel-menu-select"> shows an example of running the
	<guimenuitem>CD player</guimenuitem> from the
	<guisubmenu>Audio</guisubmenu> submenu.</para>

	<screenshot>
	  <graphic fileref="pix/panel-menu-select"></graphic>
	</screenshot>
      </figure>

      <para>
	Here are a few things you should explore in the panel: you
	would probably discover them anyway because exploring the
	panel is an entertaining thing to do, but this will speed the
	process up.</para>
      <para>
	First of all: it is possible to take panel menu entries and
	create short-cut icons on the panel itself.  You do it with
	the <guisubmenu>Add to panel</guisubmenu> submenu of the
	<guimenu>panel</guimenu> menu which you obtain when you click
	the <guibutton>foot</guibutton> button.  You can see and
	example of this in <xref linkend="panel-icons">.

	<title>GNOME panel: adding another icon</title>
	<screenshot>
	  <graphic fileref="pix/panel-add-icon"></graphic>
	</screenshot>
      </figure>
      <para>
	The result is another icon on the panel (<xref
	  linkend="panel-icons">); clicking that icon will bring up
	the associated application.</para>
      <figure id="panel-icons">
	<title>GNOME panel: with the new icon</title>
	<screenshot>
	  <graphic fileref="pix/panel-icons"></graphic>
	</screenshot>
      </figure>
      <para>
	Next: try clicking on the little arrows at the two sides of
	the panel: they allow you shrink or re-expand the panel, so
	you can get it out of the way easily.
      </para>
      <para>
	The other feature I will mention now is <firstterm>panel
	applets</firstterm>.  Applets are little programs which
	require little visual space and thus can be run
	<emphasis>on</emphasis> the panel.  There are many applets,
	such as a clock, a mail alert, and shrunken versions of the CD
	player and the mixer.
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>The file manager &mdash; <command>gmc</command></title>
      <para>
	The GNOME file manager is based on the GNU Midnight
	Commander, and can be invoked from the panel's main menu or by
	typing at the shell:
      <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gmc &</userinput></literallayout>
      <para>
	The file manager allows users to navigate their directories
	and the rest of the filesystem with an easy graphical point
	and click interface.  GNOME Midnight Commander adds even more
	functionality through its notion of <firstterm>Virtual File
	Systems</firstterm> (<acronym>VFS</acronym>): these are
	abstractions which allow you to navigate files that are not on
	your file system as if they were.  Examples of virtual
	filesystems are the ftp filesystem and the tar filesystem:
	files can be accessed by anonymous ftp or by extraction from a
	tar file, and Midnight Commander treats them in the same way
	as local files.</para>
      <para>
	Midnight Commander is powerful and vast, and it has its own
	manual (available by typing <command>man mc</command>) so I
	will not give more detail now.
      </para>

	<title>GNOME hex editor &mdash; ghex</title>
	<para>
	  The GNOME hex editor is an editor for non-ASCII files.  It
	  can be invoked from the panel or by typing

	  Electric Eyes can be invoked from the panel or by typing

	</para>
	<para>
	  Electric Eyes has its own manual with several screenshots,
	  available in the GNOME help system, so I will not attempt to
	  describe its myriad features here.  I will only mention that
	  to "get going" you probably do not want to invoke
	  <command>ee</command> with no options, but rather you want
	  to invoke it directly on an image file or on several files,
	  or even a directory with several images.</para>
	<para>
	  Once Electric Eyes is running you can bring up all the menu
	  options by clicking the right mouse button, as shown in
	  <xref linkend="ee-menu">.  The most interesting options are
	  probably those available <guisubmenu>Edit</guisubmenu>
	  submenu.

      <sect2>
	<title>GNOME mixer (gmix)</title>
	<para>
	  GNOME also has some sound programs; one of them is a mixer
	  application.  A mixer allows you to control how your
	  computer's sound card handles sound from various inputs:
	  using sliders you can block out some sound inputs while
	  raising the gain on others, just like the mixer console in
	  a live music PA system.</para>
	<para>
	  You can invoke the GNOME mixer from the panl or by typing
	  <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gmix &</userinput></literallayout>

	<para>
	  In <xref linkend="gmix"> you can see a screenshot of
	  <command>gmix</command> running on my laptop which runs
	  GNU/Linux with GNOME and has a Sound Blaster card. You will
	  notice that some channels are stereo while others are mono.
	  For each stereo channel there is a
	  <guibutton>Lock</guibutton> button which ensures that the
	  right and left channel will have the same gain.  You will
	  also notice that there are <guibutton>mute</guibutton>
	  buttons to completely ignore a certain channel.

	  <para>
	    If you have trouble running <command>gmix</command> you
	    might want to make sure that sound is properly configured
	    for you.  With older versions of Linux you might have to
	    re-configure and build the kernel with support for your
	    sound card.  With recent distributions (such as Red Hat
	    5.x) you can run <command>sndconfig</command> to select
	    and enable your sound card at runtime.

	<title>Property settings</title>
	<para>
	  There are three basic property setting commands that affect
	  your graphical environment:
	  <command>background-properties</command>,
	  <command>keyboard-properties</command> and
	  <command>mouse-properties</command>.  These commands are
	  usually meant to be invoked from the panel, but they can
	  also be invoked by typing
	  <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>background-properties &</userinput></literallayout>
	  <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>keyboard-properties &</userinput></literallayout>
	  <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>mouse-properties &</userinput></literallayout>
	</para>
	<para>
	  The <command>background-properties</command> command, among
	  other things, a way of visually selecting a screen saver and
	  running a preview in a small window.  This is shown in

	<title>Line printer configuration (gulp)</title>
	<para>
	  GNOME has an interface for configuring printers, called
	  <command>gulp</command> (which could stand for GNOME Unified
	  Link to Printers).  You can invoke <command>gulp</command>
	  from the panel or by typing
	  <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gulp &</userinput></literallayout>

	  I present a snapshot in <xref linkend="gulp">, but

	<title>GNOME time tracker (gtt)</title>
	<para>
	  The GNOME time tracker allows you to easily figure out how
	  much time you allocate to various projects.  You can start
	  the GNOME time tracker from the panel or by typing
	  <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gtt &</userinput></literallayout>
	</para>

	<para>
	  The time tracker is well documented, and its manual can be
	  found with the GNOME help browser, so here I will simply
	  show three screenshots of how the time tracker starts up
	  (<xref linkend="gtt-basic">), how you can add a
	  new project (<xref linkend="gtt-new">) and what it looks
	  like when you have two projects going (<xref
	    linkend="gtt-2proj">).  If you stop working on one project
	  and start working on another one, just do a simple mouse
	  click (with the <mousebutton>left</mousebutton> button) on
	  the new project.
