    <title>Preface to the alpha release of GNOME</title>
    <para>
      Dear GNOME enthusiast,
    </para>
    <para>
      This document accompanies the alpha release of GNOME, shipped in
      May of 1998.  At this time GNOME is an interestign and useful
      suite of programs, but it is under very active development.
      This means that you will find many programs which are incomplete
      and some bugs which you would not expect from a mature product.</para>
    <para>
      Having said this, GNOME is already today an exciting product,
      and many of the programs are quite useful.
    </para>

      <title>What is GNOME</title>
      <note>
	<para>
	  If you tire of explanations and just want to get going with
	  GNOME in a practical way, please skip the rest of this
	  preface and read <xref linkend="a-sample-session">
	  immediately.</para>
      </note>
      <para>
	GNOME is a project which endeavors to provide a complete,
	consistent, state of the art and free user environment for
	UNIX systems.  This includes:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
	<listitem><para>
	    An <firstterm>application framework</firstterm> &mdash;
	    this consists of a style guide for applications along with
	    a set of libraries which enforce the style requirements.
	    For example, the GNOME libraries allow a programmer to
	    invoke standard menus and dialog boxes.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	    A <firstterm>file manager</firstterm> &mdash; the GNOME
	    file manager is based on the well known <application>GNU
	      midnight commander</application>, which has been endowed
	    with a GNOME&ndash;compliant graphical interface.</para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	    A <firstterm>panel</firstterm> &mdash; this replaces the
	    button&ndash;bars sometimes provided by UNIX window
	    managers.  The panel also allows the running programs in
	    little squares in the panel, both by swallowing X Window
	    programs and by running especially written
	    <firstterm>applets</firstterm>.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	    <firstterm>Session management</firstterm> support &mdash;
	    applications are notified so they can save state
	    information when a user logs out: the next time a session
	    is started, these applications can pick up where they left
	    off.
	    </para>
	</listitem>
	<listitem><para>
	    A <emphasis>suite of GNOME applications</emphasis> &mdash;
	    these have written (or adapted) to use the GNOME
	    facilities, and thus present a consistent look and
	    behaviour.
	  </para>
	</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      <para>
	There are many more facets to GNOME, and much information can
	be found at the <ulink URL="http://www.gnome.org/">GNOME web
	  page</ulink>.
      </para>
      <para>GNOME is a GNU project, was started in 1997, and has
	developed very quickly.  <acronym>GNOME</acronym> can be
	thought of as an acronym standing for GNU Networked Object
	Model Environment.
      </para>

      <title>Obtaining and installing GNOME</title>
      <para>
	GNOME is in early stages and being modified very actively, so
	the only way to get up to date instructions on how to grab and
	install GNOME is to look at the GNOME home page at <ulink
	URL="http://www.gnome.org/">http://www.gnome.org/</ulink>

    <title>A sample session</title>
    <para>
      When GNOME becomes stable there will be a simple recipe for
      starting up a GNOME session: users will simply type
      <command>gnome-session</command> and it will start up their
      environment.  But we are not yet at that point: right now UNIX
      users usually run their stable X Window environment with their
      favorite window manager, and the run the GNOME panel and other
      programs from the shell or from their
      <filename>.xsession</filename> or <filename>.xinitrc</filename>
      files.
    </para>
    <para>
      I assume that you have the GNOME programs and libraries
      installed on your system, and that they are in your path.

	    (gnome-help-browser) toward the start of your
	    session.</para>

    <sect1>
      <title>Using GNOME's internationalization support</title>
      <para>GNOME has had internationalization (sometimes called
	<acronym>i18n</acronym> support from the earliest phases of
	development.  To get a GNOME program to give you messages in
	your favourite language, simply set your
	<envar>LANGUAGE</envar> environment variable to the two letter
	code for that language.</para>
      <para>For example, the <command>gnome-hello-2-i18n</command>
	command invokes the <application>gnome-hello</application>
	variant which includes support for internationalization. If
	you want to see this program (or any GNOME application)
	display its menus and other information in
	<emphasis>Italian</emphasis>, you could type (for Bourne shell
	or bash):</para>
      <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>LANGUAGE=it</userinput></literallayout>
      <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>export LANGUAGE</userinput></literallayout>
      <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gnome-hello-2-i18n</userinput></literallayout>
    </sect1>

  <chapter>
    <title>A tour of some GNOME applications</title>
    <para>
      I will now give a very brief description of what you can do with
      some GNOME programs.</para>
    <sect1>
      <title>The GNOME help browser (gnome-help-browser)</title>
      <para>
	GNOME has a help browser which allows you to view
	documentation in several formats, including UNIX man pages,
	GNU info files and HTML documents.  The documents are shown
	with an HTML rendering widget, so any documentation format
	that can be translated into HTML could be rendered with
	<command>gnome-help-browser</command>.
      </para>
      <para>
	You can invoke the help browser from the penel or from the
	shell by typing
      </para>
      <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gnome-help-browser &</userinput></literallayout>
      <para>
	The initial window you get is shown in <xref
	  linkend="help-browser-initial">
      </para>
      <figure id="help-browser-initial">
	<title>GNOME help browser &mdash; initial screen</title>
	<screenshot>
	  <graphic fileref="pix/help-browser-initial"></graphic>
	</screenshot>
      </figure>

      <para>
	The help browser is well documented, so once you are in it you
	can click on the help icon (which looks like <inlinegraphic
	  fileref="pix/help-icon.gif"></inlinegraphic>) and see the
	help browser's online help.  I will only add one more tip on
	using the help browser: you can invoke it from the command
	line directly and give it a file URL, which has to be a
	complete path to the file.  So if you have just written or
	generated a web page, you could view it with by typing
	<literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gnome-help-browser file:&lt;full-path&gt;/file.html</userinput></literallayout>
	or more conveniently
	<literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gnome-help-browser file:`pwd`/file.html</userinput></literallayout>
      </para>

      <para>
	You can see an example of invoking the help browser on a file
	in <xref linkend="help-browser-sample">: it is a snapshot of
	the top level of this document as I am writing these
	paragraphs.  I invoked it with
	<literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gnome-help-browser file:`pwd`/gnome-intro/book01.html</userinput></literallayout>
      </para>

      <figure id="help-browser-sample">
	<title>GNOME help browser &mdash; a specific HTML page</title>
	<screenshot>
	  <graphic fileref="pix/help-browser-sample"></graphic>
	</screenshot>
      </figure>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>The <application>panel</application> and its applets</title>
      <para>
	The panel is invoked directly by the GNOME session manager
	when you type <command>gnome-session</command>, but it can be
	also be invoked directly from the shell by typing
      <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>panel &</userinput></literallayout>
      </para>
      <para>
	The panel will bring up a bar at the bottom of the screen,
	shown in <xref linkend="panel-basic"> (note that this bar will
	run across the entire bottom of your screen &mdash; in this
	picture I have narrowed it so that it will fit in a browser
	more conveniently.
      </para>
      <figure id="panel-basic">
	<title>GNOME panel: the basic panel bar</title>
	<screenshot>
	  <graphic fileref="pix/panel-basic"></graphic>
	</screenshot>
      </figure>

      <para>
	Starting programs with the panel is easy: you simply click on
	the foot icon, from which you will get the top level launcher
	menu, as shown in <xref linkend="panel-menu">.
      </para>
      <figure id="panel-menu">
	<title>GNOME panel: main menu</title>
	<screenshot>
	  <graphic fileref="pix/panel-menu"></graphic>
	</screenshot>
      </figure>

      <para>
	Most of the entries in the panel menu are submenus; <xref
	linkend="panel-menu-select"> shows an example of running the
	<guimenuitem>CD player</guimenuitem> from the
	<guisubmenu>Audio</guisubmenu> submenu.</para>

      <figure id="panel-menu-select">
	<title>GNOME panel: selecting one of the submenus</title>
	<screenshot>
	  <graphic fileref="pix/panel-menu-select"></graphic>
	</screenshot>
      </figure>

      <para>
	[FIXME: need to describe applets and panel configuration; I
	should also mention how you can click on the sides of the
	panel to make it slide over.]
      </para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1>
      <title>The file manager &mdash; <command>gmc</command></title>
      <para>
	The GNOME file manager is based on the GNU Midnight
	Commander, and can be invoked from the panel's main menu or by
	typing at the shell:
      <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>gmc &</userinput></literallayout>
      <para>
	The file manager allows users to navigate their directories
	and the rest of the filesystem with an easy graphical point
	and click interface.  GNOME Midnight Commander adds even more
	functionality through its notion of <firstterm>Virtual File
	Systems</firstterm> (<acronym>VFS</acronym>): these are
	abstractions which allow you to navigate files that are not on
	your file system as if they were.  Examples of virtual
	filesystems are the ftp filesystem and the tar filesystem:
	files can be accessed by anonymous ftp or by extraction from a
	tar file, and Midnight Commander treats them in the same way
	as local files.</para>
      <para>
	Midnight Commander is powerful and vast, and it has its own
	manual (available by typing <command>man mc</command>) so I
	will not give more detail now.

	<title>GNOME hex editor &mdash; ghex</title>
	<para>
	  The GNOME hex editor is an editor for non-ASCII files.  It
	  can be invoked from the panel or by typing
      <literallayout><prompt>$ </prompt><userinput>ghex &</userinput></literallayout>
	  Using <command>ghex</command> is quite straightforward, and
	  it has a manual available in the GNOME help browser.
