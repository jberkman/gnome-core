>      This document accompanies the alpha release of GNOME, shipped in
      May of 1998.  At this time GNOME is an interesting and useful
      suite of programs, but it is under very active development.
      This means that you will find many programs which are incomplete
      and some bugs which you would not expect from a mature product.</P
><P
>      Having said this, GNOME is already today an exciting product,
      and many of its programs are quite useful.
