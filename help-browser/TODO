    use real path for ghelp
    toss the tree widget -- too slow
    geometry and ui cleanups
    use gnome-config

    geometry - figure out how to set column widths and let first one expand
    first visit
    save to file
    better date string

    rethink the url/docobj processing and callback entries to the
