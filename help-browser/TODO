   integration into GNOME apps in the future

    use real path for ghelp
    toss the tree widget -- too slow

    broken clist
    first visit
    save to file
    better date string
 - add entry box to main window
 - info
 - code cleanup
    rethink the url/docobj processing and callback entries to the
     docobj processing path
    encapsulate all globals & allow for multiple windows
 - add "magic" urls (eg "man:ls")
 - man2html remove contents and man2html tags
   fix path (eg /usr/X11R6/man)
 - make man2html & info loadable modules
