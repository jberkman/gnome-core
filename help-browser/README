Gnome Help Browser & Sample Code
--------------------------------

This is a very basic help browser and a sample program (ripped from
gnome-hello) showing how to use it. The basic idea is there is a
topic.dat file which contains section names and the file which it
corresponds to. These cause the creation of menu entries under the 'Help'
menu of the main menubar of a GnomeApp. Look at the sample.c for more
details.

This requires you to check out a version of gnome-libs so that the 
gnome_app_create_menus() will work properly.


TODO
----
 - Make a better scheme to reference files/section than using a real filename?
 - Make the help browser do something interesting!
 - work on DocBook output to generate topic.dat automatically (need to use
   special tags in DocBook to denote links which should go into the 'Help' 
   menu).
 - Need to have help browser<->application communication for better
   integration into GNOME apps in the future
