Gnome Help Browser & Sample Code
--------------------------------

This is a very basic help browser and a sample program (ripped from
gnome-hello) showing how to use it. The basic idea is there is a
topic.dat file which contains section names and the file which it
corresponds to. These cause the creation of menu entries under the 'Help'
menu of the main menubar of a GnomeApp. Look at the sample.c for more
details.

This requires you to check out a version of gnome-libs so that the 
gnome_app_create_menus() will work properly.

UPDATE (2/20/98)
----------------

Lots of new goodies!

 - history works now (back and forward buttons)
 - new internal structure for transport/mime conversion/etc
 - browse man pages!
 - simple http transport using 'lynx -source' - use as a WEB BROWSER
    (example:  gnome-help-browser http:/www.gimp.org/gtk/')

The program 'gnome-man2html' is installed in the standard bin location
for GNOME binaries, and is used by the help browser. Also, lynx is
expected to be on the standard PATH for http transfers.


TODO
----
 - Make a better scheme to reference files/section than using a real filename?
 - add caching code (its written, need to integrate)
 - work on DocBook output to generate topic.dat automatically (need to use
   special tags in DocBook to denote links which should go into the 'Help' 
   menu).
 - Need to have help browser<->application communication for better
   integration into GNOME apps in the future
 - fix broken toc
    use real path for ghelp
    toss the tree widget -- too slow
    geometry and ui cleanups
    use gnome-config    
 - fix history
    broken clist
    first visit
    save to file
    better date string
 - add entry box to main window
 - info
 - code cleanup
    rethink the url/docobj processing and callback entries to the
     docobj processing path
    encapsulate all globals & allow for multiple windows
 - add "magic" urls (eg "man:ls")
 - man2html remove contents and man2html tags
   fix path (eg /usr/X11R6/man)
 - make man2html & info loadable modules
