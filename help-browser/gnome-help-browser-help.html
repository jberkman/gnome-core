<H2> Gnome Help Browser Documentation </H2>

The Gnome Help Browser is an interface to the various forms of
documentation present on your computer, and from other computers
via the Internet. This short document will describe the main
features of the Gnome Help Browser.

<H3> Main Window </H3>
The main window displays the contents of the document in an HTML
window. Some document types, such as <I>man</I> pages, require
a conversion from their native format to HTML. This will be done
automatically by the Gnome Help Browser.

Using the main window is much like using a traditional web browser.
Clicking on links will cause the browser to load the data from that
link and display it.

At the top of the main window are several buttons. The <b>Next</b>
and <b>Prev</b> button cause the browser to go back and forth
through the history of the pages you have visited during this session.
The <b>Close</b> button quits the browser.

<H3> Table of Contents Window </H3>

In addition to the Main Window, there is a Table of Contents Window. It
lets you walk through some of the documentation on your system using
a tree widget. It acts much like a traditional file manager. Clicking
on an entry in the tree causes that document to be loaded in the
Main Window for viewing.
