	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_button_press): supplement the x_comp and
	y_comp values by the frame - win position distance.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwmh_desktop_motion): don't recalculate win.{x,y} -
	frame.{x,y} upon every single move, simply rely on x_comp and y_comp.

Sat Sep 11 17:27:35 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_property_atom2info): translate property atoms to
	info flags, according to desk-relative or task-relative properties.

1999-08-21 Anders Carlsson  <anders.carlsson@tordata.se>

	* gwmh.c: Fixed error with the KWM_WIN_ICON hint.

Fri Aug 20 12:36:57 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* stripe.xbm: removed

	* gwmdesktop.c: use a checker board to indicate active area.

Fri Aug 20 11:09:48 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.[hc]: added a ::check-task signal to determine
	visibility of individual tasks.

	* deskguide_applet.c: connect to GmwDesktop's ::check-task signal
	for all desktops to hide tasks according to the new config flags
	show_hidden_tasks, show_shaded_tasks, show_skip_winlist and
	show_skip_taskbar.
	don't show iconified tasks at all.

Fri Aug 20 10:28:55 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.[hc]: split up gwmh_task_show() into gwmh_task_deiconify(),
	gwmh_task_focus(), gwmh_task_raise() since some code needs only
	part of the show() functionality.
	gwmh_task_show() still incorporates the functionality of the above
	fucntions and is more efficient since it coalescs the task updates
	and will only sync once. though, it will not try to assign focus to
	SKIP_FOCUS tasks anymore. it'll also unshade shaded tasks now.

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_task_get_mini_icon): fixed this function up a bit
	(codingstyle), added assertments, get_typed_property_data() returns
	memory allocated through glib, so use g_free not XFree.

1999-08-04 Anders Carlsson <anders.carlsson@tordata.se>

	* gwmh.[hc]: Added gwmh_task_get_mini_icon

Tue Jul  6 12:47:37 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_button_press): don't change desktops
	(pages) on button press if Control is being held, so windows can
	be dragged around in this case.

1999-07-05  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@comm2000.it>

	* deskguide_applet.c (main): Create applet "deskguide_applet", not
	"gnomepager_applet".

Sat Jun 26 01:57:11 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.h: 
	* gstc.h: provide workaround for G_GNUC_PRETTY_FUNCTION definition
	from old (pre 1.2.2) glib versions.

Sat Jun 26 01:08:53 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>
