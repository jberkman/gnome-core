Thu Oct  7 14:04:01 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: added bug-fixing option to configure unified_area
	support for different window managers (FVWM2 and SawMill need this).

	* gwmh.[hc]: added support for wms with unified areas, i.e. where
	the current area always changes on all desktops. we should evaluate
	a _WIN_UNIFIED_AREA property at some point to figure this, but
	until then i simply added gwmh_desk_set_hack_values() to hard configure
	certain bug workarounds.
	John Harper <john@dcs.warwick.ac.uk> provided significant code
	portions for the unified_area support.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_desk_notifier): always update our idea
	of the current area if GWMH_DESK_INFO_CURRENT_AREA changed, no
	matter whether we are the current desktop.

	* gwmh.c (hack_a_client_list): grab the server while doing excessive
	tree queries.

Thu Oct  7 02:46:20 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_create_desk_widgets): feature stacking of
	desktops into a specified number of columns (rows) and wrap them
	around upon packing. this allowes for the much requested "grid"
	layout of desktops (as opposed to the normal grid layout of areas
	which works fine out of the box already).
	the number of rows/columns can be configured through the geometry
	page in the properties dialog.

	i'm wondering what else people will request from deskguide to fit
	their needs, someone's probably still hiding, wanting to request
	INBOX folder browsing support ;)

Thu Sep 23 22:27:34 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_task_set_area): 
	* gwmh.c (gwmh_task_set_desktop): since most window managers didn't
	actually follow the spec to honour a client message for desktop and
	area changes, we have to violate the spec here as well, and modify the
	properties directly (besides sending the client message) ;(

Thu Sep 23 21:06:50 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.[hc]: 
	* gwmh.[hc]:
	* gstc.[hc]: foooof. after 14h of hacking and debuging,
	desk-guide is actually able to deal with non-gnome compliant
	window managers. it performs all neccessary tasks, such as fetching
	client list etc... itself. deep magic ;)
	as a neat side effect, desk-guide can actually manage the desk solely
	now, if no window manager is at all present.
	probably the first and only pager that capable ;)
	window manager switching works fine in general, i.e. between compliant
	window managers as well as non-compliant ones, back and forth. there
	are just a few very old twm-based cripples that cause gdk to crash by
	destroying windows immediatedly after a ConfigureEvent arrived (fixed
	in Gtk+-1.2.5).
	i changed the intial error dialog to an alert dialog that strongly
	recommends compliant wms, but we may actually remove this dialog now.

Thu Sep 23 20:24:42 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.[hc]: added detected_gnome_wm field to the desk structure,
	so users can figure if we have a compliant window manager. this
	value may now change during a programs lifetime, i added appropriate
	"reboot" hooks to the gwmh code to be triggered upon window manager
	changes. detected_gnome_wm should always be checked by interested
	applications if the notification mask contains GWMH_DESK_INFO_BOOTUP.

	* gwmh.c (task_delete):
	* gstc.c (gstc_parent_delete_watch): 
	carefully reset event masks on foreign windows.

Thu Sep 23 19:12:45 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* ok, got the last bits worked out for non gnome compliant window
	managers, basically, we have to do everything ourselves, i.e.
	guess what the actuall client list is. this would be easy if there
	were no window manager at all, but with all the decorations floating
	around, it's hard to tell what an actuall task is.
	hopefully the current heuristics proove to be usefull in the common
	case.

Thu Sep 23 17:25:39 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c: reset GWMHA atoms if no GNOME comlainant window manager
	is present, that way we don't get bogus proprtty values.

Thu Sep 23 14:06:17 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.[hc]: added GWMH_DESK_INFO_FORCE_EVERYTHING value, so the
	user can forcefully update everything (happens upon gwmh_init()
	as well).

	* deskguide_applet.c (main): queue a GWMH_DESK_INFO_FORCE_EVERYTHING
	update if we don't know the window manager, so the newly setup
	notifiers get called.

Thu Sep 23 13:46:28 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: added bug-fix configure option to workaround
	window managers that move their decoration windows instead of the
	application window upon XMoveWindow(), occurs with at least
	AfterStep, Enlightenment, FVWM and IceWM.

Thu Sep 23 10:43:43 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_task_update): translate frame and window coordinates to
	current desk when updating geometries.

Thu Sep 23 09:50:42 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwmh_desktop_motion): constrain movement area to our
	window plus a threshold border of 5 pixels.
	(gwm_desktop_button_release): abort task moves.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_button_press): only show tasks and change
	desktop+area on button1. tasks can be moved now with button2.
	(policy suggested by owen).
	
	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_draw): fixed a minor offset problem with
	setting x/y_origin.

Thu Sep 23 08:33:58 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_create_desk_widgets): don't poke around
	indelicately in foreign class structures, use gwm_desktop_class_config()
	now. set desired area size from newly added configuration options.

	* gwmdesktop.[hc] (gwm_desktop_class_config): new function to set global
	class configuration, will automatically update all existing widgets.

	* deskguide_applet.c (gp_init_gui): changed packaging so we don't expand
	the desktop widgets by default and with that destroy the constrained
	aspect ratios.

Thu Sep 23 05:35:41 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: internationalized the configuration option
	array (Andreas Persenius <ndap@swipnet.se>).

1999-09-18  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* *.png: Transparency added to pixmaps.

1999-09-17  Richard Hult  <rhult@hem2.passagen.se>

	* deskguide_applet.desktop: Added Swedish desktop entry.

Fri Sep 17 13:55:27 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: show hidden tasks by default.

	* gwmh.[hc]: added GwmhHints, GwmhState and GwmhLayer enums, adapted
	code to not use the namespace polluting WIN_* cruft from gnome
	anymore.

Fri Sep 17 13:17:31 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.c: feature ->raised_grid in property dialog.

	* gwmdesktop.[hc]: added ->raised_grid class field so people that want
	it can have the grid drawn on top of the tasks.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_map): make sure we are queued for a redraw
	if we draw double buffered, since our expose handler relies on ::draw
	being already called.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_draw): always draw border on top of the
	tasks.

1999-09-15  Kjartan Maraas  <kmaraas@online.no>

	* deskguide_applet.c: Replaced TRANSL with _() to get the
	strings to show up in gnome-core.pot.
	* deskguide_applet.h: Commented out #define TRANSL......
		
1999-09-12  Matthias Warkus  <mawa@iname.com>

	* *.png: Pixmaps added; used in about dialog and desktop entry.

Sat Sep 11 17:59:16 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_button_press): supplement the x_comp and
	y_comp values by the (frame - win) position distance.

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwmh_desktop_motion): don't recalculate (win.{x,y} -
	frame.{x,y}) upon every single move, simply rely on x_comp and y_comp.

Sat Sep 11 17:27:35 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_property_atom2info): translate property atoms to
	info flags, according to desk-relative or task-relative properties.

1999-08-21 Anders Carlsson  <anders.carlsson@tordata.se>

	* gwmh.c: Fixed error with the KWM_WIN_ICON hint.

Fri Aug 20 12:36:57 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* stripe.xbm: removed

	* gwmdesktop.c: use a checker board to indicate active area.

Fri Aug 20 11:09:48 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.[hc]: added a ::check-task signal to determine
	visibility of individual tasks.

	* deskguide_applet.c: connect to GmwDesktop's ::check-task signal
	for all desktops to hide tasks according to the new config flags
	show_hidden_tasks, show_shaded_tasks, show_skip_winlist and
	show_skip_taskbar.
	don't show iconified tasks at all.

Fri Aug 20 10:28:55 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.[hc]: split up gwmh_task_show() into gwmh_task_deiconify(),
	gwmh_task_focus(), gwmh_task_raise() since some code needs only
	part of the show() functionality.
	gwmh_task_show() still incorporates the functionality of the above
	fucntions and is more efficient since it coalescs the task updates
	and will only sync once. though, it will not try to assign focus to
	SKIP_FOCUS tasks anymore. it'll also unshade shaded tasks now.

	* gwmh.c (gwmh_task_get_mini_icon): fixed this function up a bit
	(codingstyle), added assertments, get_typed_property_data() returns
	memory allocated through glib, so use g_free not XFree.

1999-08-04 Anders Carlsson <anders.carlsson@tordata.se>

	* gwmh.[hc]: Added gwmh_task_get_mini_icon

Tue Jul  6 12:47:37 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmdesktop.c (gwm_desktop_button_press): don't change desktops
	(pages) on button press if Control is being held, so windows can
	be dragged around in this case.

1999-07-05  Ettore Perazzoli  <ettore@comm2000.it>

	* deskguide_applet.c (main): Create applet "deskguide_applet", not
	"gnomepager_applet".

Sat Jun 26 01:57:11 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* gwmh.h: 
	* gstc.h: provide workaround for G_GNUC_PRETTY_FUNCTION definition
	from old (pre 1.2.2) glib versions.

Sat Jun 26 01:08:53 1999  Tim Janik  <timj@gtk.org>

	* deskguide_applet.[hc]: desk guide pagin applet.

	* gwmdesktop.[hc]: widget derived from GtkDrawinArea to display
	a desktop and its pages.

	* gwmh.[hc]: GNOME window manager helper code to keep track of
	the different clients (tasks) on the screen.

	* gstc.[hc]: helper code for gwmh.[hc] to monitor stacking order
	of windows.

	* initial import (26/6/1999).
