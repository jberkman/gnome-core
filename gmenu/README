In the tree window:
any button selects thr row.
button double click or button 3 single click copied the
rows data to the edit area (if it's not a folder).

root detection is now forced true until someone adds user
menus to the panel.
Folders must be emptied to delete them.

You must be root to edit the system menu.
root users do not have access to their personal icons, so
that the system menus always have system icons.
