	* Makefile.am: moved desktop file to Settings group

1999-02-16  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* delete.c (delete_desktop_entry): Change 'node' to
 	'new_current_node'.  This corrects a bug which caused gmenu to
 	crash when the last item in a submenu was deleted, as reported by
 	djw@wolfman.mit.edu.

1999-02-10  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* dialogs.c (new_item_pressed_cb):
	(save_pressed_cb): I dont know the code well, but current_path
	might become * NULL at some points.  Account for those cases.

Mon Feb  8 07:00:15 1999  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.[ch]: Version to 0.99.0, copyright to 1999.

1999-02-07  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* tree.c (tree_set_node): Just set the selection in the ctree.
  	The tree_row_selected callback will take care of the rest.
	(update_tree_highlight): Don't select the row.
	(tree_row_selected): Most of the tree_item_selected code was moved
 	here.
	(tree_item_selected): Call tree_set_node.

	* gmenu.c (main): Connect tree_row_selected to the tree_select_row
 	signal.
	(about_cb): Fixed a segfault.  One-line patch from jwb@cp.net.
  	Thanks!

	* edit.c (edit_area_changed): Don't enable the save button if it's
 	not an editable entry.
	(disable_edit_area): New function.
	(update_edit_area): Disable the edit area if the new node has no
 	path or name.  Enable the save button selectively.
	

1999-02-05  Jeff Garzik <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* gmenu.c:
	Fix segfault in about by increasing size of authors[] array to
	include terminating null.  Bug#69.

1999-02-06  Changwoo Ryu  <cwryu@adam.kaist.ac.kr>

	* gmenu.desktop: Added Korean translation.

1999-01-25  Jonathan Blandford  <jrb@redhat.com>

	* gmenu.c (main): Some very miniscule UI changes to the ctree.

1999-01-25  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* desktop.c: New file to contain all of the .desktop file
 	saving/loading routines.

	* utils.c: New file to contain all of the little utility routines.
	(basename_n): New function.

	* dnd.c: New file which now contains all of the Drag-N-Drop
 	routines.
	(gmenu_init_dnd): New function.  We no longer manually handle the
 	drag-n-drop, but instead use gtk_clist_set_reorderable() and
 	connect to the "tree_move" signal.
	(tree_moved): Expand a tree if we drop an item into it.

	* save.c: New file which handles everything that happens when the
 	'save' button is pressed.
	(save_desktop_entry_file): New function that handles things much
 	more logically.  Specifically, we now enforce a strict mapping
 	between menu item names and the names of the corresponding
 	.desktop files.  That is, a menu item named "Foo" will be stored
 	in "Foo.desktop".  Doing this greatly simplifies the interface for
 	the average user.  We handle checking for conflicts much better
 	now too.
	(set_ctree_node_data): New function to handle changes to some of a
 	menu item's fields.
	(update_desktop_entry_node): New function.

	* delete.c: New file to handle node/menu item deletion.
 	(delete_desktop_entry_file): New function to delete the
 	desktop file associated with a path.
	(remove_node_cb): New function connect to the remove_node signal
 	on the Ctree.  It handles freeing the Desktop_Data and destroying
 	the file associated with a defunct menu item.  Doing deletion this
 	way makes recursive delete possible.
	(delete_desktop_entry): Use this new function as the entry point
 	to the menu item deletion routines.  It deletes the file
 	associated with a menu item, destroys its CTree nodes, and resets
 	'current_node' if appopriate.
	(delete_recursive_cb): Recursively delete a submenu.

	* tree.c (tree_set_node): New function to be used to set the
 	current node.  It also updates the new current_desktop variable
 	and the edit area.
	(tree_item_collapsed): New callback function.  Set the current
 	node appropriately.
	
	* gmenu.c: Added a "current_desktop" global variable.  Removed all
 	of the drag-n-drop functions and put them in dnd.c.  Renamed
 	"Folder" to "Submenu" everywhere.  Added a "New Item" menu entry.
  	Moved the utility routines to utils.c.  Moved the new_item
 	callback to dialogs.c.  

	(main): Connected to the tree_collapse signal so that we can reset
 	the current node when it is no longer visible.  Use the CTree in
 	BROWSE mode.  Use a pane to separate the CTree from the edit box.
	(about_cb):  Added myself to the authors list.

	Renamed "Folder" to "Submenu" everywhere.

	* edit.c (edit_area_select_name): New function.  This selects the
 	contents of the "Name" GtkEntry widget and gives it focus.  For
 	use after the creation of a new menu item.
	(edit_area_get_filename): Removed.  The filename of the .desktop
 	file is now hidden from the user.  It was confusing and lead to a
 	lot of problems to expose that information.  Besides which, the
 	average user doesn't care, and the users who do can very well use
 	a text-editor to edit the menus.
	(create_edit_area): Removed the filename widgets.  Grab the
 	default on the 'save' button.  This doesn't work though, for some
 	reason.

	* dialogs.c (create_folder): Expand the parent folder.  Use
 	tree_set_node() to set the current node.
	(create_folder_pressed_cb): Renamed from create_folder_pressed.
	(new_item_pressed_cb): New callback function for when the 'new
 	item' toolbar button is pressed.
	(delete_dialog_cb): Use the new delete.c node/menu entry deletion
 	functions.
	(delete_pressed_cb): "Delete this menu entry?" instead of "Delete
 	file?".  Handle recursive deletion of non-empty submenus.

	Most of the item saving functionality has been removed from this
 	file, broken down into more logical functional units, and put into
 	save.c.

	(save_pressed_cb): This function has been completely rewritten to
 	use the new save.c routines.

	Renamed "Folder" to "Submenu" everywhere.

1999-01-21  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

	* gmenu.c (menu_drag_data_received): Renamed
 	folder_drag_data_received to this.  Now you can drop onto
 	non-folders and have it move the items around.  Check that src !=
 	dest, which was causing badness.

	(toolbar): Added a "New Item" button.
	(new_item_cb): Callback for the "New Item" toolbar button.

	* edit.c (new_edit_area): The default new item name is "New Item"
	(create_edit_area): Ifdef out the 'New' button.  It's useless now,
 	and its placement was always confusing.

	* dialogs.c (create_folder): New function to abstract the folder
 	creation routines away from the callback.

	(save_dialog_cb): Do not leave the .desktop name as
 	"untitled.desktop".  Set a name if the user did not set one.
  	Update the edit area to reflect the new filename.
	(save_dialog_dentry): Don't prompt the user about saving.  That's
 	just obnoxious.

	(save_dialog_dentry): New function to abstract the dentry saving
 	away from the callback, a little bit.
	
	* gmenu.c: Commented out the Properties toolbar item, since it is
 	useless now.

	(drag_data_received): Renamed folder_drag_data_received.  Now you
 	can move items around by dragging and dropping.

1999-01-21  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>
	
	* gmenu.c (main): Initialize support for dropping menu items onto
 	the ctree.
	(possible_drag_item_pressed): Save the GtkCTreeNode being dragged
 	in drop_data.

	(drag_data_get_cb): Handle drops to external apps and to gmenu.

	(folder_drag_data_received): New function to handle drops onto the
 	ctree.  Move a menu item here if the user has write permission, and
	the drop was on a folder.

	* tree.c (tree_item_selected): Always update the edit area when
 	someone clicks on a tree item.

1999-01-18  Jeff Garzik  <jgarzik@pobox.com>

	* gmenu.c (main):
	s/gtk_ctree_set_reorderable/gtk_clist_set_reorderable/

 	accelerator from ^F to ^N to match the standard.

1999-01-06  Nat Friedman  <nat@nat.org>

Mon Aug 10 08:41:14 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* tree.c: Quick hack to test a standby dialog while gmenu reads the
	menus. If interested in seeing 'walking gnome feet', please try this
	out and tell me if it's just code bloat. On really fast machines,
	this dialog may be too quick to really see anything.
	* wait-feet.h: The pixmaps for the walking feet. Was larger, but
	managed to use less colors to decrease size.

Mon Jul 20 22:50:21 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.[ch], edit.c, order.c, tree.c, dialogs.c: added ability to
