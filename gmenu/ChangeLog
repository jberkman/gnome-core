Fri Aug 14 15:15:29 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* Makefile.am (gmenu_SOURCES): Added wait-feet.h

Wed Aug 12 06:10:04 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.[ch], tree.c (menu_item_selected): Reworked the tree selection
	code, with tips from Lars Hamann. Now right clicking on an item will
	copy it's contents to the edit area, double clicking was removed.
	* gmenu.[ch], dialogs.c, edit.c, order.c, tree.c: Version now 0.3.0

Tue Aug 11 07:43:52 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.c: Added gnome style toolbar in favor of the old row of
	buttons below the tree of menus. Main window is not displayed until
	after the menus are read, which was distracting attention from the
	standy dialog, resulting in a cleaner looking startup.

Mon Aug 10 08:41:14 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* tree.c: Quick hack to test a standby dialog while gmenu reads the
	menus. If interested in seeing 'walking gnome feet', please try this
	out and tell me if it's just code bloat. On really fast machines,
	this dialog may be too quick to really see anything.
	* wait-feet.h: The pixmaps for the walking feet. Was larger, but
	managed to use less colors to decrease size.

Sun Aug  9 14:12:18 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* tree.c: cleanups, fixes, and optimizations.
	(get_ctree_count): new function to calculate # of nodes in a ctree,
	maybe a similar routine should be in gtkctree.[ch] ?

	* gmenu.[ch], dialogs.c, order.c, tree.c: Changed all casts of GList *
	to GtkCTreeNode *'s where applicable, and fixed all the other casts

	* edit.c, tree.c, dialogs.c: Include <config.h>.

Tue Jul 21 00:39:15 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.h, edit.c, dialogs.c: fixed bug that caused a segfault or
	duplicate directory tree cration when an entry is saved multiple
	times successively. Desktop entry items that do not apply when editing
	a directory's properties are greyed out.

Mon Jul 20 22:50:21 1998  John Ellis  <johne@bellatlantic.net>

	* gmenu.[ch], edit.c, order.c, tree.c, dialogs.c: added ability to
