George's TODO
-------------

somehow make it restart on theme change

follow settings from capplet

add it to gsm

Short Term
----------
Maybe merge system and user lists into one. That way if a user
wants to run a custom .ad before most others, they could
create a ~/.grdb/AAMyOpts.ad and it would get run in right order.


SGML documentation.

add --update option to grdb-capplet to use the appropriate settings to
call grdb.

Make configure.in test for recent gnome version.

New font finding code can't return NULL. Once we're sure everything
is okay with it (and we won't be going back to old stuff), clean this
up.

Use .ad files from kde2, after a bit of playong with them

Later On
--------
Add support for "legacy" KDE apps ;) It should be straightforward to
change KDE's style options to match a gtk theme. This would be conditional
at compile time. Has anyone linked an app with gtk and kde/qt before?
(Maybe a gmodule using kde? so a precompiled grdb might work regardless
of whether or not a user had installed kde, need to experiment)
