0.2.4 : 28AUG2000
* Added --constants command line. This just prints the constants grdb
  defines and exits. If, for example, you want to match you gtk theme
  colors to your windowmanager, you could use this and perl to
  massage the output. Andre Bonhote asked about this for fvwm2, and I
  think  this is a really good way to go.
* Incorporated patch from Peter Teichman to complete netscape font
  theming and use fixed fonts in Motif. If you don't like this second
  change, look at the bottom of AAAMotif.ad and follow the comments.

0.2.3 : 25JUN2000 
* This will be last release till august as I am 5 weeks away
  from my CS degree (and still working fulltime)
* fixed bug causing files in ~/.grdb to essentially be ignored
* changed RVPlayer.ad to not have global settings and therefore not
  give netscape a huge download dialog.

0.2.2 : 12JUN2000
* fixed .spec file to include new icon

0.2.1 : 11JUN2000
* fix crash caused by opening font selection dialog and pressing
  OK without selecting a font.
* Added capplet icon provided by Christian Schaller

0.2.0 : 10JUN2000
* added control center capplet
* removed usage of GdkFontPrivate, instead we fall back to
  using the GtkRcStyle, as the theme-selector capplet does

0.1.2 : 21MAY2000
* moved main.c into grdb subdirectory and split it into 
  main.c, fonts.c, colors.c and grdb.h

0.1.1 : 15MAY2000
* added command line and env. variable to specify fixed font.
  (not an optimal solution, but it works)
* determing italic and bold fonts is done more reliably.
* added a Ddd.ad for the ddd debugger, see comments in the file
  for limitations.
* Removed the support for unused #define values. These were 
  INACTIVE_BLEND, ACTIVE_BLEND, and TITLE_FONT.


0.1.0 : 28APR2000
* initial font support, this is not finished yet
* added command line arguments via popt
* fixed problems with configure --with-included-gettext
* now using grdb.spec.in to generate grdb.spec

* fixed some bugs in releasing gtk resources when done with them.
* added support for user .ad files in $HOME/.grdb
* changed code to guesstimate HIGHLIGHT and LOWLIGHT values.
* grdb.spec file for RPMS (courtesy Chris Ausbrooks)

0.0.2 : 24FEB2000
* initial automake/autoconf
* we now process .Xdefaults if it exists
* changed WINDOW_BACKGROUND to use style->base[GTK_STATE_NORMAL]
* some code formatting tweaks

0.0.1 : 19FEB2000
* Use popen() instead of temporary file.
* Sort .ad directory entries after we read them.
* use `gnome-config --datadir`/grdb as location of .ad files,
   this is set in the Makefile
* added GPL License information and crude attempt at documentation
