28AUG2000
* release 0.2.4

12AUG2000
* added --constants command line
* incorporated patch from Peter Teichman to complete Netscape font
  selection and used the fixed font in motif lists and text widgets.
* incorporate patch from Bart Banhaute to wildcard the average
  width field of the xlfd when computing bold and italics. These
  fonts tend to be a smidge wider than normal fonts and this
  was causing either failed matches or squished looking bold fonts.

24JUNE2000
* copied and slightly changed RVPlayer.ad from kde2. This should avoid
  oversized netscape download dialog.

16JUNE2000
* fixed dumb mistake in grdb/main.c causing user files never to
  be used. 
	
11JUNE2000
* added grdb-capplet.png (icon for capplet) generously provided by
  Christian Schaller
* updated grdb spec from Chris Ausland for above icon

10JUNE2000
* fixed crash in capplet when opening font selection dialog and
  immediately pressing OK (without having ever selected a font)

04JUNE2000
* added a little blurb about capplet into README

30MAY2000
* changed code to get font same way theme capplet does (try GtkRcStyle
  and fallback to default gtk font if it doesn't exist either)
* install grdb-capplet.desktop in both capplet list and Settings menu

24MAY2000
* use gnome_config_push_prefix() in capplet
* removed skip fonts button from capplet

22MAY2000
* added header comments to capplet

21MAY2000
* (not in 0.1.2) added capplet subdir with control-center capplet
   (still a work in progress)
* released 0.1.2
* moved main.c to grdb subdir, and split it into main.c,
  colors.c, and fonts.c.

13MAY2000
* added a -f/--fixed command line arg to specify fixed font as well.

12MAY2000
* re-added FIXED_FONT into .ads and use "fixed" for now in main.c
  (otherwise normal xterms look terrible as it tries to use the
   themes font as fixed width)
* add support GRDB_FIXED_FONT env. variable to let people pick the
  fixed font.
	
10MAY2000
* commented out FIXED in the .ads
* removed FIXED_FONT, TITLE_FONT, ACTIVE_BLEND, and INACTIVE_BLEND.
  Only FIXED_FONT was used, and none of these have a clear mapping
  to gtk anyways.

06MAY2000
* added data/Ddd.ad to get ddd looking good
  (see comments in Ddd.ad if font sizes are wrong)
* try for -o- font if -i- font can't be loaded
* if italics or bold can't be found, fall back to normal
  (avoid warnings about non-existing fonts when starting programs)

02MAY2000
* 0.1.0 released (before following changes applied)
* >finally< imported grdb into a local cvs tree. Now I can be more
  abusive with my changes.
* added code to look up xlfd from XA_FONT property before accessing
  private guts of gdkfont. This doesn't work with truetype fonts
  and xfstt, so the ugly stuff stays for now.
	
22APR2000
* cleaned up some formatting
* added --nofonts/-n to turn off the new fonts stuff
* added command line args section to README
* fixed --with-included-gettext (hopefully).
  changes made to Makefile.am and configure.in	

16APR2000
* update README on font support situation.	
* added popt command line to control verbosity
* added code to do the font stuff into grdb.
	
14APR2000
* worked out first pass of bold and italics from xlfd.
  it is really naive and still needs to be moved in to main.c
	
08APR2000
* added "standard gettext macros" as generated by glade for non-gnome
  projects.

03APR2000
* started adding font support
	
18MAR2000 
* released 0.0.3

12MAR2000
* added grdb.spec, courtesy Chris Ausbrooks.

10MAR2000
* internationalization added, no translations yet.

09MAR2000
* do a gtk_style_copy() when we get the style, and a gtk_style_unref()
  instead of g_free() when we're done.

08MAR2000
* changed to gtk_window_new(GTK_TOP_LEVEL) when fetching theme, 
  so that we use window theme colors instead of button. See the
  gnome-look theme for a case where it makes a difference.

04MAR2000
* added support for user .ad files in $HOME/.grdb
* don't free return from g_get_home_dir() else bad things will happen
   next time we call it (if we ever do).
* added a Verbose flag which, if set, causes diagnostic output to be
   generated.  Currently, this can only be enabled by editing source.
   Eventuall, this will be a command line argument.

01MAR2000
* tweaked HIGHLIGHT and LOWLIGHT, I think they're close enough. I looked
  at how gtk does it, but it doesn't seemed to be exported publicly.

24FEB2000
* released 0.0.2

23FEB2000
* autoconf of xrdb location (searches path)

22FEB2000
* autoconf of datadir install
* some work on documentation

21FEB2000
* initial automake/autoconf
   (need to do data install and xrdb location still)
* we now include .Xdefaults if it exists
* changed WINDOW_BACKRGROUND to use style->base[GTK_STATE_NORMAL]
* some small formatting tweaks

19FEB2000
* Use popen() instead of temporary file.
* Sort .ad directory entries after we read them.
* use `gnome-config --datadir`/grdb as location of .ad files,
   this is set in the Makefile
* added GPL License information and crude attempt at documentation
* released 0.0.1

18FEB2000 
* Proof of Concept release.
