	* gnome-terminal.c (new_terminal): Allow shrinking.  This makes
	the window auto-resize to the small size when the font has
	changed. 
	(drop_data_available): Added drop support for urls to the
	terminal.  You can now drag file names and icons to the terminal
	and get the file listing.

	* gnome-terminal.c: we want to count from 0 up when counting # of env var,
	not down :) Should fix the problem with the font being loading properly
	from previous preferences.

	* gnome-terminal.c: First time I check the ChangeLog for the
	gnome-terminal program.
