	* gnome-terminal.c (new_terminal): Allow shrinking.  This makes
	the window auto-resize to the small size when the font has
	changed.

	* gnome-terminal.c: we want to count from 0 up when counting # of env var,
	not down :) Should fix the problem with the font being loading properly
	from previous preferences.

	* gnome-terminal.c: First time I check the ChangeLog for the
	gnome-terminal program.
