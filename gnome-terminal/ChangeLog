	* gnome-terminal.c (apply_changes): Only apply changes once.
	
	* gnome-terminal.c (drop_data_available): Important DnD bug fix
	that walks the list of dropped files correctly.

1998-05-04    <msf@redhat.com>

	* menu.c: commented out include of zvt/forkpty.h

1998-05-03  Miguel de Icaza  <miguel@nuclecu.unam.mx>

	* gnome-terminal.c (new_terminal): Allow shrinking.  This makes
	the window auto-resize to the small size when the font has
	changed. 
	(drop_data_available): Added drop support for urls to the
	terminal.  You can now drag file names and icons to the terminal
	and get the file listing. 
	(rxvt, xterm): Added the actual color maps for the nxterm and rxvt
	(close_terminal_cmd): Oops.  Fix old piece of code: I was not
	shutting down due to code reogranization.

	* Makefile.am (LDADD): Include UTIL_LIB, not -lutil.

1998-05-01  Michael Fulbright  <msf@redhat.com>

	* gnome-terminal.c: we want to count from 0 up when counting # of env var,
	not down :) Should fix the problem with the font being loading properly
	from previous preferences.

	* gnome-terminal.c: First time I check the ChangeLog for the
	gnome-terminal program.
