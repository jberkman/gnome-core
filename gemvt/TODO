rename gtk_menu_position_func

- add small scripts to the toolbar

- we need to add dingus support to it (http://dingus.mit.edu).

- add more menuing functionality

- font selection,  we need a gnome independant font selector for this.

- need the different color schemes that miguel wants to have
  implemented.

- support xterm arguments

- enable multiple term mode, configurable like so:
  - all terms in a notebook
  - all terms in different windows
  - all terms in one window but having only one visible (like
    a real console does)
  switch between terms with <ctrl>+Fxx keys, this requires real
  keymap support in libgtktty
